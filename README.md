
# Production Record Project for OOP

 **Scenario/Description**
 I was give the task to program a production program for a company, that involves keeping track of the product, and recording them to a database. I used Intellij, Java, scene builder and H2 primarily to create the program. Here's the scenario; You have been hired to create software for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced. Without the software, workers on the production floor are physically producing items and having to write down what is produced in a production log book. Management would like the production tracking to be more automated so the workers don't need to spend as much time recording what was produced, the log will be more accurate, and it will be easier to generate production reports.In addition to the ability to record production, the software also needs the ability to add to the product line (the catalog of products that are able to be produced).
**Briefly address the 5 W's.**  
*What is the project?*  A production record program,
*Who made it? Did you make it independently or with a team?*  Mainly independently,  however when I got stuck my great classmates and professor helped me. 
*When did you make it? At what level of experience and proficiency were / are you?*
Throughout the fall semester of 2019 at FGCU, I feel I have learn a lot and progressed heavily in java,  
*Why did you make it? For fun? For an assignment? How does it relect you as a person?*
Made it for an assignment, fun level was their but not the pushing factor, what made me motivated was getting the features implemented, and seeing that there are more than one way to accomplish the goal was intriguing.  
*Where did you make it? What school / class?*  @FGCU and @my residence.
